# SquareUp
A Flappybird-sque game but with a sprinkle of bullet hell

## TODO LIST

1. Incrementing difficulty, that changes the spawnrates not the frame rate
2. a Star that changes the level
3. Polish 
   1. Actual Ground Texture
   2. When you land, there will be a puff of smoke slight and a slight squish
   3. the star appears with a from a diamond cross shape (5-10 second or so load in animation)
   4. When you get the star, add a 1000 points and speed difficulty decreases but a new enemy is added.
   5. A leaderboard for top highest
   6. If you move off screen, leave a marker that tracks the x cord
